# Libft

This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

---

### Walkthrough
This project will require a lot of reading, rigor, and attention.

#### First Part
The first part is about copying functions from the standard LibC.
For this part, you have to copy everything exept `Undefined Behaviors`; Most of them are segfaults because of `NULL Strings`. It's up to you how you handle these behaviors, you can crash, exit the function early with an error return value, etc...
#### Second part
The second part is about creating unexisting functions.
For this part, there is no `Undefined behavior`, your function is not supposed to crash, you have to protect your function for every case, and return an error return value (`NULL`, `0`, etc...).

### Tips
- Pay attention to every possible case ! Most cases of retries are because of a unique case that you have not seen! So, don't rush.
- Do the bonuses, chained lists are very useful and a properly coded Libft will help you a lot in your future projects
- For the same reason as above, don't hesitate to add custom functions, even if they do not count as bonuses, they might be very helpful!
