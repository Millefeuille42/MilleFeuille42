# 42 Cursus Guide by Millefeuille

Here you can find guides and references for 42 new Cursus.

## First Circle
### [Libft](https://millefeuille42.github.io/MilleFeuille42/libft/)
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

## Second Circle
### [Get Next Line](https://millefeuille42.github.io/MilleFeuille42/gnl/)
Whether it's a file, standard input, or even later a network connection, you'll still need to read content line by line. It is therefore time to tackle this function, which is essential for a number of your next projects.

### [ft-printf](https://millefeuille42.github.io/MilleFeuille42/printf/)
This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will then be allowed to reuse the function in your future projects. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.
