### Huge/cool projects
- [piscibot](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/piscibotReloaded) (Golang): A Discord bot to track your and your friends progress at 42, at least that is what's official. Actually it was more of a way to organize a secret pool where we would gamble fake internet points on the people doing the "piscine". I swear v3 will come someday, and it will be awesome
- üßë‚Äçüéì [ft_irc](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/ft_irc) (C++98): A not so fully-compliant ultra basic IRC server (missing all the federation stuff). So stable the school computer crashed before the server could when I was running stress tests (even if it doesn't poll on write-ready but hey, we were learning)
- :warning: [mercury](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/mercury) (Rust): My very first project in Rust. It's a full suite of tools and libs to write server/clients for IRC. It will include some example projects, such as a TUI client.
- :warning: [VulTracks](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/VulTracks) (Golang + JS): All-In-One music library manager, has Golang as the main brain and REST API, the UI is made in JS and Bootstrap, using a Golang templating engine. Lacks some features to make it actually interesting though
- ‚ùå :warning: Mischief (Golang): A full private server (with even more features) for [REDACTED] game, because always-online gaming is bad and should be banned! This involved a LOT of new stuff for me, such as: reverse engineering, UDP and HTTPS snooping, trust poisoning, creating the documentation of their API...  (Code available on demand for specific requesters, for legal reasons)

### Smaller projects (still cool, but way less huge)
- [TracimDaemon](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/TracimDaemon) (Golang): A daemon that will listen to Server-Sent Events of a remote tracim and spread them locally using UNIX sockets, this is to limit bandwidth usage by only having a single subscriber
	- [TracimDaemonSDK](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/TracimDaemon_QuickStart) (Golang, Python): A Python and a Golang SDK to write consumer apps for TracimDaemon. This can also (and mostly) be used to create a consumer/producer service to chain several daemons and thus produce a complex local event pipeline for a (or several) remote tracim
- [libtraceX](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/libtraceX) (C99): A in-code wrapper to produce the same output as `strace`, useful for debugging since it can be used to run on specific subsets of code
- [libft_enhanced](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/libft_enhanced) (C99): My own implementation of some forbidden-by-school `libc` functions among other personal libs (strings, linked list, buffered print, logging, error management...)
- [DiabloIVTool](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/DiabloIVTool) (Golang): A fully featured Discord bot that will interact with several community APIs to provided information about Diablo IV in game events and unique items (among other things)
- [Telecord](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/TeleCord) (Golang): "Driver" based bridge for Discord and Telegram
- [Daemonize](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/Daemonize) (Golang): A toolkit to daemonize Golang code. This is not really POSIX compliant yet. I did it because someone on the internet told me it was not possible... (and because I actually needed it)
- [normiNet](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/normiNet) (Golang): A http client/server bundle that I designed to run the 42 norm lint tool on a remote server. This was ONLY made so I did not have to install Python on my PC
- ‚ùå SpotifyParty (Node JS): A (ahead of it's time) POC of the current Spotify Jam feature, this got me into some kind of trouble and this is why I don't have any code to show 

### Other projects
You can find all of my other projects, such as most of my school projects ([malloc](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/ft_malloc), [nm](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/ft_nm), [ls](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/ft_ls), [strace](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/ft_strace), [lem-ipc](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/lem-ipc), [piscine_cybersecurity](https://github.com/Millefeuille42/Piscine_Cybersecurity)...). They are worth a look the time but did not deserved to be put here in my opinion.
